# BEMO2 Middleman Test site

This is just a simple middleman environment that live within the ```test/middleman```branch only.

The idea is use this branch everytime we need to test what we do during bemo2 refactoring. Few simple rules:

* Don't merge this branch in master
* Just rebase this branch on the feature branch you want to test
* Avoid the editing of files in ```bemo-core``` and ```bemo-style``` in this branch. Do you really want to cherry pick this stuff?
